Teacher Grading Tool For Brightspace

Overview:
This tool helps teachers easily calculate and produce final grades for students based on a preset grading rubric. The tool supports automatic averaging of multiple homework and quiz scores (with the lowest quiz score dropped), then calculates the weighted final grade based on midterm and final project scores. Final grades are saved in the database and can be viewed at any time.

Features:
- Enter grades for each student in the class.
- Automatically drop the lowest quiz score.
- Calculate the weighted average for homework, quizzes, midterm, and final project.
- Final scores are rounded to the nearest whole number.
- Store all grades in a database for future access.
- Display the final grades for all students.

Instructions:

1. Add Student Grades

- Input the grades for 5 homework assignments, 5 quizzes, the midterm, and the final project. All fields must be filled before submitting.
- Click "Submit" to calculate the final grade and save all grades for that student in the database.

2. How Final Grade is Calculated

- Homework Average: The homework scores are averaged and weighted at 20% of the final grade.
- Quiz Average: The lowest quiz score is automatically dropped. The remaining quiz scores are averaged and weighted at 10% of the final grade.
- Midterm: The midterm score is weighted at 30%.
- Final Project: The final project score is weighted at 40%.
- The tool then calculates the total weighted grade and rounds it to the nearest whole number.
